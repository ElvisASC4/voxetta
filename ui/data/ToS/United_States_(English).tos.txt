Google Participant Release

and services (such as the Google Assistant). The new voice might resemble your voice.

license (a) to, and to permit others to, store, copy, process, and otherwise use the Feedback in
perpetuity in connection with the Purpose; and (b) to any copyrights, rights of publicity, and any
other legal rights necessary in order for Google and others to use the Feedback as permitted by
this release. You agree to Google storing the Feedback until you revoke your consent, and
processing the Feedback for the Purpose outlined herein and as described in Google's Privacy
Policy (available at http://www.google.com/privacy.html). You specifically waive and release any
potential intellectual property, right of publicity or right of privacy claim against Google or others
for using or sharing Your Feedback. You also acknowledge that you won't have access to the
Feedback.

2. You confirm that You are of the age of majority and have full power and authority to authorize

4. Any information provided to You by Google and any Feedback You provide will be considered
confidential (the “Confidential Information”), and the following terms will apply: (a) You may use
Confidential Information only for the Purpose; (b) You will use a reasonable degree of care to
protect Confidential Information and to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of
Confidential Information; and (c) You may not share the Confidential Information with any third
party in any manner.

PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES UNDER
THIS RELEASE IN EXCESS OF $100. CALIFORNIA LAW, EXCLUDING CALIFORNIA’S

THIS RELEASE (collectively, “CLAIMS”). ALL CLAIMS WILL BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN
THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, USA, AND

assign your rights or delegate your obligations under this release, by law or otherwise, without
the prior written consent of Google and any other attempt to transfer or assign is void. Failure to
enforce any provision in this release will not constitute a waiver. If any provision is found
unenforceable, the balance of this release will remain in full force and effect. This release is the
